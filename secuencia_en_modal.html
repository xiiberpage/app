                <p>Kuler, a product created by Adobe to make life easier for web designers. It’s a type of software where you can create color palettes for designs and even explore other palettes that other people in the community have made. Recently Adobe
                    has created an application that works hand-in-hand with Kuler for mobile devices where the application takes the most prominent colors of an image you capture and creates a pallet from it which you can also save and let other people
                    explore.
