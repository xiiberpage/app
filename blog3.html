Take it easy. Know why you're here. And remember to balance your internal energy with the environment. </p>

		<p class="hide">Listen to the silence. And when the silence is deafening, you're in the center of your own universe. It's OK to get Rib-grease on your face, because you're allowing people to see that you're proud of these ribs. The best way to communicate is compatible. Compatible communication is listening with open ears and an open mind, and not being fearful or judgemental about what you're hearing.</p>

					<p>Thats an advanced modern oxymoron. It was good, I like it and I beleived it. Man you got a way with using words. Thats like a lariat that does a snake whip on your back legs, I mean on the back of your legs - not that you have 4 legs - and pulls you this way, and thats what that line did to me and I believed every minute of it. Until I looked at the quadrangle that it produced with the verbs used in the sentence.</p>
